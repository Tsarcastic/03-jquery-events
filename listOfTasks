1) DONE: index.html link to new script tags

2) DONE: Use jQuery to also add the author name as a data-attribute of the newly cloned article.
//       Doing so will allow us to use selectors to target articles, based on who wrote them.


3) DONE: If the select box was changed to an option that has a value, we need to hide all the articles,
//       and then show just the ones that match for the author that was selected.
//       Use an "attribute selector" to find those articles, and fade them in for the reader.

4) Done: Just like we do for #author-filter above, we should handle change events on the #category-filter element.
  //       When an option with a value is selected, hide all the articles, then reveal the matches.
  //       When the blank (default) option is selected, show all the articles, except for the template.
  //       Be sure to reset the #author-filter while you are at it!

5) TODO: Add an event handler to .main-nav elements that will power the Tabs feature.
  //       Clicking any .tab element should hide all the .tab-content sections, and then reveal the
  //       single .tab-content section that is associated with the clicked .tab element.
  //       So: You need to dynamically build a selector string with the correct ID, based on the
  //       data available to you on the .tab element that was clicked.

  6) TODO: Add an event handler to reveal all the hidden elements,
  //       when the .read-on link is clicked. You can go ahead and hide the
  //       "Read On" link once it has been clicked. Be sure to prevent the default link-click action!
  //       Ideally, we'd attach this as just 1 event handler on the #articles section, and let it
  //       process any .read-on clicks that happen within child nodes.
